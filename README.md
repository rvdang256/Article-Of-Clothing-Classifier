# Using Deep Learning to Identify Articles of Clothing

The dataset being used is the Fashion-MNIST dataset which is composed of 28x28 grayscale images of 70,000 fashion products from 10 categories, with 7,000 images per category. The categories are T-shirt/top, trouser, pullover, dress, coat, sandal, shirt, sneaker, bag, or angle boot. The products themselves are from Zalando (a German online retail company), and the training set has 60,000 images and the test set has 10,000 images. Using this dataset, the goal is to create two deep learning models using a Recurrent Nueral Network and a Convolutional Neural Network that are able to classify the type of the article of clothing given an image of it. More for infromation about the two deep learning models, please read the report listed in the repo.
